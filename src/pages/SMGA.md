## When we play
#### Weekly games
We have a standing tee time of 9AM on Monday's and Fridays.  Depending on the number of players for a given playday,we will shotgun start teams starting on 17, 18, and number one.  We focus on keeping all rounds under 4 hours by using:
* net double bogie maximum rule of the world handicap system
* local rule for out of bounds & lost ball (alternative to stroke & distance - two stroke penalty take to fairway)
* friendly encouragement on best cart practices for pace of play
* regular communication on pace of play
* "Balance of handicaps" in a group.
#### Tournaments
We schedule 4 tournaments each season that are also played on either a Monday or Friday.  The schedule is published in the spring at the start of each golf season.  These tournaments are a mix of individual and two person team events.  


## Basic format of playdays
In the spirit of friendly competition, we collect a players pool each playday ($5) and a closest to the pin pool ($1) that is payed out each playday to the winners (team/teams or individual/individuals) depending on the format for that playday.  
#### Monday's (signup for the event on Invited Club website / app)
On Monday's a member of the SMGA "manager of the day" will arrange the teams and the game.  This could include:
* individual events (low net, quota)
* Team events (2,3 & 4 man formats depending on number signed up with "balanced handicap" teams)
* Occasionally just play no competitiion (green aeration, odd circumstances)

Each golfer responsible for entering their score into the GHIN system
#### Friday's (signup by responding to golf genius email invite)
On Friday's we normally use golf genius based games setup by the proshop.  This could include:
* Quota based games
* 4 man Team formats (2 best net, Cha,Cha,Cha , Lone Ranger) 
* 3 man Team formats (Scramble, low net, etc.

Using golf genius, teams are balanced based on handicaps and scores are entered into the app during play with real time scoring, leaderboard, and final results available within the app.  Golf genius will also automatically post individual scores to the GHIN handicap system.
